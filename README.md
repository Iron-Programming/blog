######## MotD
Howdy team! Welcome new members, great to have you on! I have sent a request to Nitro Type to up the allowed officers, but I'm afraid they aren't going to do that. Since we have so many good racers (you all are amazing), besides the co-captain and senior officer, we may have to take turns being officers. Anytime you need to post a MotD (once per day please) then change your name to "Officer YourName". Thanks & happy racing everyone! :) Please post thumbs up if this MotD sounds good to you. :)
